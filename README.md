# PhysX-Rugby-Kicker-Game
Implementation of a hybrid of Rugby and Medieval Fantasy game written in C++ and PhysX. The game has a contemporary Rugby feel with respect to the sport and physics (e.g. gameplay rules, kicking functionalities, dimensions and
aspects of the play field and ball, scoring mechanics), whilst including elements of Medieval Fantasy (e.g. weaponry, battles, jousting, transportation, trap mechanics, etc.).
The implementation of the Fantasy Medieval Rugby game consists of implementing a Rugby Free Kick, which includes a playfield, a halfway line, a rugby ball, a player-controlled
foot/character/medieval machinery ball-kicking mechanic, a goal, and player feedback upon successfully scoring a goal.

The game features contemporary Rugby and Medieval Fantasy mechanics (e.g. accurate Rugby physics) game objects geometry (compund shapes), physical
parameters (mass, material properties), and physics modelling (collision handling, forces). The game also features elements such as artificial static obstacles (traps, other standing players, bumpers), moving obstacles (hinges, traps) and different playing surfaces.
