# PhysX Rugby Kicker Game

C++ single-screen 3D video-game created using PhysX amd OpenGL libraries.

The project brief was to develop and implement in C++ a single-screen 3D video-game based on a medieval/fantasy Rugby Kicking game and to demonstrate the following:

- a player-controlled foot/character/medieval machinery ball-kicking mechanic
- player feedback upon successfully scoring a goal.
- accurate Rugby physics, additional gameplay rules, ball kicking controls
- game objects geometry (e.g. dimensions, shape, etc.)
- physical parameters (e.g., mass, etc.)
- physics modelling (e.g., collision handling, forces, etc.)
- physics materials and properties
- PhysX functionalities including compound shapes, materials, joints, motors, triggers, filters, collisions groups
